# HangmanForms
Hangman in a simple Windows Forms format

1.0 is a quick Hangman tested in the Windows Forms-format.
There's no current plans to evolve this project, it was more like a coding challenge while having a few hours over an evening.
Saving this project here tho in case I feel like pushing this project further, there's UI elements to add/improve, and the structure of the code is horrendous :)
That could very well be because I sidestepped from the original plan and added/altered features. You know the basic tip: have a plan - stick to it? This was brainstorm coding!
Actually, this 1.0-version might also serve as a platform for playing around with code structure too. Another reason to keep this project here.
